Write a simple console application in .NET 6  that allows the user to perform some simple actions on products database. 

It should provide basic funcionality of adding, updating, searching, and filtering products. In addition the user should have an ability to calculate item price in different currencies (PLN, USD and EUR - use some predefined constants for calculations).
Please separate operations into commands with different numbers, as following:

1. Get product (searches for product with given name)
2. Add new product
3. Update product
4. Get the cheapest product
5. Get the most expensive product
6. Get last modified product (returns last modified product, depending on its modification date)
7. Calculate product price in different currency (calculates product price depending on currency given by the user)
8. Exit

The command that will be executed should depend on user keyboard input.

Feel free to edit, refactor and add everything you need (classes, methods etc) in existing project.
After finishing the application write as many unit tests as you can (you can use any testing framework).
